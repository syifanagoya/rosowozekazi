This show addressed various scopes in political, paranormal, and entertainment topics. After two weeks, the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, he was pressured to change the name of the show, too, but he refused.</p><p>Lewis later moved the show to KBER, and it was the top-rated in its time slot in Salt Lake City.
