His parents, Stacy and Derrick Sr., both played football in high school, and his grandmother was a track and field athlete.</p><p>Growing up, Henry was a standout athlete in both football and track and field. He attended Yulee High School, where he set the national high school record for rushing yards in a season with 4,261 yards in his senior year. He also scored 55 touchdowns and led his team to a state championship. Henry was named the 2012 USA Today High School Football Offensive Player of the Year, and he was rated as a five-star recruit by multiple recruiting services.</p><p>After graduating from high school, Henry committed to play college football at the University of Alabama. He played for the Crimson Tide from 2013 to 2015, and he became one of the most dominant running backs in college football history. In his junior year, he won the Heisman Trophy, which is awarded annually to the most outstanding player in college football. He also led the nation in rushing yards with 2,219 yards and scored 28 touchdowns.</p><p>Henry decided to forgo his senior year and enter the NFL draft. He was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft with the 45th overall pick. In his rookie season, he played in 15 games and rushed for 490 yards and five touchdowns. He became the team’s starting running back in his second season and had a breakout year, rushing for 1,059 yards and 12 touchdowns.</p><p>In the 2018 season, Henry had a slow start but finished strong, rushing for 585 yards and seven touchdowns in his final four games. He continued his dominant play in the 2019 season, rushing for 1,540 yards and 16 touchdowns. He also had an incredible performance in the Titans’ playoff run, rushing for 377 yards and two touchdowns in three games.</p><p>Henry had another outstanding season in 2020, leading the league in rushing yards for the second year in a row with 2,027 yards. He also scored 17 touchdowns and was named the NFL Offensive Player of the Year. He helped lead the Titans to the playoffs again, but they were defeated in the Wild Card Round by the Baltimore Ravens.</p><p>Henry is known for his powerful running style and his ability to break tackles. He is one of the most dominant running backs in the NFL and is often compared to other legendary running backs like Earl Campbell and Jim Brown. He has been named to the Pro Bowl three times and has been named a First-Team All-Pro twice.</p><p>Off the field, Henry is known for his charitable work. He started the Derrick Henry Foundation in 2018, which is dedicated to improving the lives of at-risk children and their families. He has also been involved with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and has participated in numerous community service events.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Derrick Henry Height: How Tall Is Derrick Henry?</h2><p>Derrick Henry’s height is 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 meters). He weighs approximately 247 pounds (112 kilograms).</p><p>Henry’s height and weight are considered unusual for his position, as running backs in the NFL are typically shorter and lighter. However, his combination of size, strength, and speed has helped him become one of the most dominant running backs in the league.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2cq6qZmLhutMSnqbJlmJq2qLTTZp%2Bor12prq24jKKqZpyVp7%2Bqr8pmn56moq58</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./heaven-wait-warren-beatty-movie-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heaven ___ Wait (Warren Beatty movie)">&larr;
