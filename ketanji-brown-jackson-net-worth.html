Early in her childhood, Jackson moved with her family to Miami, Florida, where her father attended the University of Miami School of Law. In the area, she went to Miami Palmetto Senior High School. After graduating in 1988, Jackson enrolled at Harvard University, where she studied government and did improvisational comedy. She graduated magna cum laude in 1992, and went on to attend Harvard Law School, from which she obtained her JD in 1996.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Following her graduation from law school, Jackson became a law clerk to Judge Patti B.
